    # Overview
    Trestle provides identity data for businesses. This identity data is key for building and maintaining great customer relationships.

    ### _Base URL_

    https://api.trestleiq.com/ - US West (Default)

    ### _Authentication_

    Trestle controls access to the API and data via an API Key. The API key is the primary data
    authentication method for your account. Your usage is recorded and reported via the API
    Key. You may use a single API key for multiple Trestle APIs.

    # FAQ
    ### _How do I get an API Key?_

    - [Sign up for a Developer Portal account](https://portal.trestleiq.com/signup). Once approved, you can send a request to any of Trestle's APIs. Here's a brief overview of Trestle's APIs:

    - [Reverse Phone API](https://trestleiq.com/reverse-phone-api/): To find the current resident or business associated with the phone and their information, including demographic data, address, associated people and more.

    - [Caller Identification API](https://trestleiq.com/caller-identification-api/): To find the single owner and location of the person or business calling in.

    - [Smart CNAM API](https://trestleiq.com/smart-cnam-api/): Validates a phone number and provides person or business name associated to the phone.

    - [Phone Validation API](https://trestleiq.com/phone-validation-api/): Lightweight phone check to identify line type, carrier, validity, and more.

    - [Reverse Address API](https://trestleiq.com/reverse-address-api/): To find the current resident or business associated with the address and their information, including demographic data, phones, associated people and more.

    - [Find Person API](https://trestleiq.com/find-person-api/): To find a person’s details, including demographics, all current and historical addresses, and phone numbers.

    - [Real Contact API](https://trestleiq.com/real-contact-api/): Validates whether a lead is real, confirms the person is who he/she says they are, and grades the contactability of the lead.

    ### Do you have a Postman Collection?

    Yes, we do, it can be found <a href="https://www.postman.com/trestleiq/workspace/trestle-identity-data-apis" target="_blank">here</a>.
    You will need to fork the collection to use it and also an API Key, for which you can [sign up here](https://dev-portal.trestleiq.com/accounts/create).

    ### _Where can I check the status of the service?_

    You can find the API status at the <a href="https://status.trestleiq.com/" target="_blank">Trestle Status Page</a>.

    ### _Can I submit a request using POST method?_

    We recommend using GET for simplicity.
    POST is also supported, in this case `api_key` must be in the request body and not part of the URL.

    ### _I have more questions, who can I contact?_

                      Trestle's activity scores range from 0 to 100. A score of 100 means consistent activity in the last 12 months, and a score of 0 means a disconnected number or no activity has been seen in the past year.

                      An activity score of 70 or above means there is a high confidence that the phone is connected, assigned to a subscriber, and someone has been taking calls consistently.
                      An activity score of 30 or below means there is a high confidence that the phone is either disconnected or no one will answer the call when the number is dialed in.
                      An activity score of 50 means Trestle doesn't have enough signals to predict whether the phone is connected or disconnected/inactive.

                      If you want to filter leads based on the activity score, the following rules can be recommended:
                      - Prioritize dialing good numbers with consistent activity: Scores 70 or above.
                      - Weed out leads with disconnected/inactive numbers: Scores of 30 or below.

                      Trestle's activity scores range from 0 to 100. A score of 100 means consistent activity in the last 12 months, and a score of 0 means a disconnected number or no activity has been seen in the past year.

                      An activity score of 70 or above means there is a high confidence that the phone is connected, assigned to a subscriber, and someone has been taking calls consistently.
                      An activity score of 30 or below means there is a high confidence that the phone is either disconnected or no one will answer the call when the number is dialed in.
                      An activity score of 50 means Trestle doesn't have enough signals to predict whether the phone is connected or disconnected/inactive.

                      If you want to filter leads based on the activity score, the following rules can be recommended:
                      - Prioritize dialing good numbers with consistent activity: Scores 70 or above.
                      - Weed out leads with disconnected/inactive numbers: Scores of 30 or below.
