                        Trestle's activity scores range from 0 to 100. A score of 100 means consistent activity in the last 12 months, and a score of 0 means a disconnected number or no activity has been seen in the past year.

                        An activity score of 70 or above means there is a high confidence that the phone is connected, assigned to a subscriber, and someone has been taking calls consistently.
                        An activity score of 30 or below means there is a high confidence that the phone is either disconnected or no one will answer the call when the number is dialed in.
                        An activity score of 50 means Trestle doesn't have enough signals to predict whether the phone is connected or disconnected/inactive.

                        If you want to filter leads based on the activity score, the following rules can be recommended:
                        - Prioritize dialing good numbers with consistent activity: Scores 70 or above.
                        - Weed out leads with disconnected/inactive numbers: Scores of 30 or below.

                        Trestle's activity scores range from 0 to 100. A score of 100 means consistent activity in the last 12 months, and a score of 0 means a disconnected number or no activity has been seen in the past year.

                        An activity score of 70 or above means there is a high confidence that the phone is connected, assigned to a subscriber, and someone has been taking calls consistently.
                        An activity score of 30 or below means there is a high confidence that the phone is either disconnected or no one will answer the call when the number is dialed in.
                        An activity score of 50 means Trestle doesn't have enough signals to predict whether the phone is connected or disconnected/inactive.

                        If you want to filter leads based on the activity score, the following rules can be recommended:
                        - Prioritize dialing good numbers with consistent activity: Scores 70 or above.
                        - Weed out leads with disconnected/inactive numbers: Scores of 30 or below.
