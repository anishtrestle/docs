## How do I get an API Key?

[Sign up for a Developer Portal account](https://portal.trestleiq.com/signup). Once approved, you can send a request to any of Trestle's APIs.

Here's a brief overview of Trestle's APIs:

- **[Reverse Phone API](https://trestleiq.com/reverse-phone-api/)**: To find the current resident or business associated with the phone and their information, including demographic data, address, associated people and more.

- **[Caller Identification API](https://trestleiq.com/caller-identification-api/)**: To find the single owner and location of the person or business calling in.

- **[Smart CNAM API](https://trestleiq.com/smart-cnam-api/)**: Validates a phone number and provides person or business name associated to the phone.

- **[Phone Validation API](https://trestleiq.com/phone-validation-api/)**: Lightweight phone check to identify line type, carrier, validity, and more.

- **[Reverse Address API](https://trestleiq.com/reverse-address-api/)**: To find the current resident or business associated with the address and their information, including demographic data, phones, associated people and more.

- **[Find Person API](https://trestleiq.com/find-person-api/)**: To find a person's details, including demographics, all current and historical addresses, and phone numbers.

- **[Real Contact API](https://trestleiq.com/real-contact-api/)**: Validates whether a lead is real, confirms the person is who he/she says they are, and grades the contactability of the lead.

## Do you have a Postman Collection?

Yes, we do! It can be found [here](https://www.postman.com/trestleiq/workspace/trestle-identity-data-apis).

You will need to fork the collection to use it and also an API Key, for which you can [sign up here](https://dev-portal.trestleiq.com/accounts/create).

## Where can I check the status of the service?

You can find the API status at the [Trestle Status Page](https://status.trestleiq.com/).

## Can I submit a request using POST method?

We recommend using GET for simplicity.

POST is also supported. In this case, `api_key` must be in the request body and not part of the URL.

## What HTTP methods are supported?

We support both GET and POST methods. GET is recommended for simplicity. See our [Authentication guide](/guides/authentication) for details.

## What are the rate limits?

Rate limits vary by API and plan. Check your Developer Portal dashboard for your specific rate limits. If you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
