## API Key Authentication

Trestle controls access to the API and data via an API Key. The API key is the primary authentication method for your account. Your usage is recorded and reported via the API Key. You may use a single API key for multiple Trestle APIs.

## Getting an API Key

To get an API key:

1. [Sign up for a Developer Portal account](https://portal.trestleiq.com/signup)
2. Once approved, you can send a request to any of Trestle's APIs
3. Your API key will be available in the Developer Portal

## Using Your API Key

All API requests require authentication via the `x-api-key` header.

### Header Format

Include your API key in the request header:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Request

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url "https://api.trestleiq.com/3.2/phone?phone=2069735100" \
  --header "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```


```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.trestleiq.com/3.2/phone?phone=2069735100",
  {
    headers: {
      "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    },
  }
);
```


```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
}

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.trestleiq.com/3.2/phone",
    params={"phone": "2069735100"},
    headers=headers
)
data = response.json()
```

</CodeGroup>

## HTTP Methods

### GET (Recommended)

We recommend using GET for simplicity. Include the API key in the header:

```bash
GET /3.2/phone?phone=2069735100
Headers:
  x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### POST

POST is also supported. In this case, `api_key` must be in the request body and not part of the URL:

```bash
POST /3.2/phone
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
  "phone": "2069735100",
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

- Store API keys in environment variables
- Use different API keys for different environments (development, staging, production)
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Never commit API keys to version control

## Error Responses
